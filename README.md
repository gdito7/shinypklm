The purpose of this application is to ease users in doing variables/features selection in a case of high dimensional regression. 
 Instead of working with R-language scripting, this application provides a user interface that works with glmnet package of R behind that.
So far, the application covers only LASSO methods, but is planned to include also other approaches such as Group LASSO and Fused LASSO.
In this application, users are assisted with several tools, i.e Data Import, Exploration, Analytics, and Output.  
This application has been developed by a research group of staffs and students of the Department of Statistics, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, 
Bogor Agricultural University (IPB), Indonesia, as part the research grant titled,
"Statistical Methods for Variable-Group Selection in High Dimensional Regression: 
applications in bioinformatics and experimental data analysis for herbal medicine development".  \
The grant has been funded by Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education for the year of 2018 and
fully supported by Assoc. Prof. Dr. Agus Salim, La Trobe University.
